Hello!
This is a project for Accesa Summer Internship Evaluation*.
It is created in Construct 3 , a online soft for game development.
To open this project, you need to go to this web adress https://editor.construct.net/  and you can skip the tutorial.
After that, find the OPEN button and select the application. 
Enjoy my 3 level game application.

*Unfortunately in the free edition of Construct 3 there is NO possibility to write more than 500 lines of scripts,
 so the authentification library which I used is not suported(1500+ lines). As a consequence that means that the ranking also could not be done.
